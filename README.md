# SparseIdentification

This repository accomplishes the algorithm/function mentioned in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03580), which is about sparse-promoting techniques and machine learning with non-linear dynamic systems to discovering governing physical equations from measurement data through actual simulations or experiments.
