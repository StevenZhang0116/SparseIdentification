# SparseIdentification

This repository accomplishes the algorithm/function mentioned in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03580), which is about sparse-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamic systems to discovering governing physical equations from measurement data through actual simulations or experiments. We also consider the nonlinear Lorenz system to explore the identification of chaotic dynamics evolving on an attractor. 

The general schematic is illustrated in the following:
